## End to End Machine Learning Project

Created a ML model in Python to predict student performance, from the initial environment to pipelines, and logging setup to model traning and testing.

Attained an 88% accuracy rate in forecasting student performance. Built and evaluated multiple regression models (CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest). Identified significant factors influencing academic performance model prediction. Deployed model via a Flask-based web abb to allow users to input demographic and academic data and return real-time ML predictions rendered in HTML

Project was created in conjunction with a YouTube series provided by Krish Naik (https://www.youtube.com/@krishnaik06).
